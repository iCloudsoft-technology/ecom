        C-Angelx is an ‘eCommerce-Mall’ & platform that enables virtually any
        type of merchant to create its e-commerce account within it & then sell
        its merchandise or receive payments online (of sales, lay-bys,
        pre-orders, etc), or for any NPO (Non Profit Organization) to fundraise
        most efficiently and receive donations online’ - (with a customizable
        unique user-handle’ for its current & prospective patrons to find &
        follow its ecommerce account) all within the C-Angelx environment.

        C-Angelx doesn’t necessarily own the items displayed on the various
        accounts of the respective merchants, neither does it fundraise on
        behalf of NPOs - but rather serves also as a platform for prospective
        Patrons (customers, clients, supporters, etc) with C-Angelx accounts to
        also search, find and follow C-Angelx accounts of individual merchants
        and NPOs they like in order to interact with online’ using necessary
        tools made available to all users. The actual contract for sale or
        donation therefore’ is directly between the respective Merchants or NPOs
        & their Patrons (individuals).
